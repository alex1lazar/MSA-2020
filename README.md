# MSA APP 2020 

## Description

This app is intended to enhance the productivity of users. We believe that in this day and age, in order to create your best work, you need to make a habit from chunking a bigger task, prioritizing and restrict other media usage.

Therefore, the steps after login/signup would be to: create a task and chunk it into smaller subtasks, prioritize and then use the timer and the Pomodoro technique to fully focus on completing your deeds.

## Proposed Design 

**You cannot yet press all the buttons as it's not a finished concept**

First we wanted to have a good idea on the flow, screens, components and the colours scheme needed to build the app. So, we started designing first. We created wireframes on blank sheets and then converted them into digital wireframes using Adobe Xd.

For the moment, the flow of the app can be experienced using the link: https://xd.adobe.com/view/c6dc4141-7df8-4b2a-b2c9-a6149d33d27c-938f/. If the link becomes unavailable, please reach out and we'll update it. Feedback and comments are highly encouraged.
